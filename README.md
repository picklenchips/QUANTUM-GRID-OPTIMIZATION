### Project Solution:
In this project we demonstrate the potential of quantum computing in optimizing modern electrical grid systems. The overarching goal was twofold: first, to implement state-of-the-art quantum optimization methods that show significant promise in accelerating electrical grid operations in the near future, even on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ), and second, to make a platform that demystifies both electrical grid management and its optimization and allows everyone the access to interact with and learn from these optimizations.

We want to make an accessible portal to show others this potential and pave a pathway for current grid providers to consider quantum computing solutions when planning grid modernization. 

1. Translate from inputs of OSM power data or ___ to a `pandapower` network
1. Run various optimization algorithms on the network classically. 
1. Use D-Wave quantum annealing to accelerate the optimizations with quantum computing

We solve the following optimization problems with quantum methods:
1. Self-sufficient microgrid formation with predicted loads
1. Optimal AC power flow equation solving
