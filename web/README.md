This website attempts to build on the work of [OpenGridMap] and [OpenInfraMap] in providing easy access to the world's power grid infrastructure.

This work attempts to both map out all relevant power components, much like [OpenInfraMap], and specialize on electrical grid modelling. 

We take it one step further by selecting open-source grid data in real-time, which can then be passed into the Python optimization framework found in the rest of the github.

TODO:
1. Selection feature
2. Decide on pipeline backend
